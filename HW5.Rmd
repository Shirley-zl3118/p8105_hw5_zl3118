### Problem 1

```{r}



```

### Problem 2

```{r, raw data, warning=FALSE}

homicides = read_csv("homicide-data.csv")

```

In the `homicides` dataset, there are `r nrow(homicides)` observations and `r ncol(homicides)` variables, including `r names(homicides)`.

```{r}

homicides <- homicides %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ","),
  disposition_status = case_when(disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
                     disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
                     disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "resolved")) 

summary <- homicides %>% group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(total_number_of_homicides = n(), number_of_unsolved_homicides = sum(disposition_status == "unsolved")) 

summary

```

### Problem 3

```{r}



```
